# 📧 Email Spam Detection - README

## 📖 Overview
This project is an **Email Spam Detection System** that uses **machine learning** to classify emails as **spam or not spam**. The model is trained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various classification algorithms to improve accuracy.

## 🛠 Installation Guide
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
To download the project, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reese8272/Email-Spam-Detection.git
cd Email-Spam-Detection
```

### **Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### **Step 3: Install Required Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### **Step 1: Preprocess the Data**
If using a dataset, preprocess the text data before training:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

### **Step 2: Train the Model**
To train the machine learning model:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

### **Step 3: Run Predictions on New Emails**
To classify new emails as spam or not spam:
```bash
python src/predict.py --email "Your email text here"
```
OR, if you have a file:
```bash
python src/predict.py --file email_samples.txt
```

### **Step 4: Evaluate Model Performance**
To test how well the model performs on a validation dataset:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

## 🧪 Running Tests
To ensure the model and scripts are functioning correctly, run unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
This will check for:
- Data preprocessing correctness
- Model training integrity
- Proper email classification

## 📝 Understanding the Concept Behind the Code
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning classifiers** to detect spam emails. The key components include:

### **1. Text Preprocessing**
- Removing special characters, HTML tags, and punctuation.
- Tokenization (breaking text into words).
- Removing stopwords (common words like "the", "and").
- Converting words into their root form (lemmatization/stemming).

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert text into numerical data.
- Exploring **word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT)** for better context representation.

### **3. Machine Learning Algorithms Used**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** (good for text classification)
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest / Decision Trees**
- **Deep Learning Models (Optional: LSTMs, Transformers)**

## 📊 Performance Metrics
The model is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of classification
- **Precision**: How many predicted spam emails were actually spam?
- **Recall**: How many actual spam emails were correctly detected?
- **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall

## ⚠️ Potential Improvements
- Improve dataset quality for better predictions.
- Try different NLP models (e.g., transformers like BERT).
- Implement real-time email filtering.
